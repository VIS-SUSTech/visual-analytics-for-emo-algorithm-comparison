# Frontend

The frontend service of the visual analytics framework is developed with Vue3 and d3.js in JavaScript.

## Environment Requirement

- **Node.js** version `>= 18.16.0` (Maybe you can run the frontend on some Node.js versions that are out of date successfully, but we do not recommend for doing that since it may cause implicit problems.)

## Deploy and Run

To start the frontend, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Start a terminal and go to the `frontend` folder directory.
2. Ensure that you have a **correct** Node.js environment on your computer, and then execute `npm install` or `yarn` (if you are using `yarn` as Node.js package manager)
3. Execute `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` in the terminal.
